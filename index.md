## Hi, welcome to visit!
This is **Qi Qi(亓琪)** from **machine learning and optimization group** of [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/). My supervisor is **[Prof. Tianbao Yang](https://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/~tyng/)**. Before I joined UIowa, I received my master degree in **[University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/)** under the supervision of **[Prof. Thomas Weise](http://iao.hfuu.edu.cn/team/director)**.
